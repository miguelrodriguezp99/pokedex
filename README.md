## Introduction

Welcome to our React Pokedex, a responsive web application designed for Pokémon enthusiasts. This app provides a modern, user-friendly platform for exploring and learning more about your favorite Pokémon. Leveraging the latest web technologies, it offers a seamless experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, making Pokémon information accessible to everyone, everywhere.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Utilized for its component-based architecture, enabling a dynamic and interactive user experience.
- **HTML & CSS:** The foundation for structuring and styling our application's content, ensuring it is accessible and visually appealing.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Adopted for its utility-first approach, facilitating rapid UI development and ensuring responsiveness across all devices.

## Features

- **Search Functionality:** Users can easily search for Pokémon by name, streamlining the process of finding specific Pokémon details.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Detailed Pokémon Information:** By clicking on a Pokémon, users can access detailed information about it. Depending on the device:
  - **Desktop:** An aside panel animates into view from the right, displaying the selected Pokémon's details.
  - **Mobile/Tablet:** A modal appears, showcasing the Pokémon's information in a format optimized for smaller screens.
- **Evolution and Stats:** The aside panel or modal not only presents the selected Pokémon's stats but also its evolution chain. Users can click on any evolution stage to view the details of that particular Pokémon evolution, enabling a deep dive into the characteristics and development of each Pokémon.
- **Dark and Light Theme:** Catering to user preference and comfort, the application features a toggle for switching between dark and light themes, enhancing usability and visual experience at any time of day.
